# Predicting-Breast-Cancer-Treatment-Response
This project explores using machine learning to predict how patients with breast cancer will respond to treatment. By analyzing patient data to predict PCR (classification) and RFS (regression) using both clinically measured features and features derived from magnetic resonance images (MRI) prior to chemotherapy treatment., the model aims to:

Identify patients likely to achieve Pathological Complete Response (pCR).
Support personalized treatment plans.
Potentially reduce over/under-treatment.
